# To Do

1. **Readme and project overview in Jupyter Hub**

2. **Use LLM to Generate Project/App names**
   - Also generate a project logo

3. **4 - 5 User Scenarios**
   - We have this but maybe add more step by step
   - Also add the mermaid diagram to show these scenarios
   - Identify data, tools, prompt structures

4. **Prompt development**
   - We should have structured prompts for each scenario (already kind of have this)
   - Test in code or in LLM user interface
   - Develop workflows for how the app works  
     *Probably the most code heavy part of it*

5. **Evaluation/testing**
   - Show the bets and results of the bets
   - Do statistical analysis on the bets
   - Also show how app responds to different user scenarios (like the language it uses, questions it asks, etc.)
   - Here we can test adversityâ€”how well it stays on topic  
     *In one test we could purposely try to distract it and see how well it does*
