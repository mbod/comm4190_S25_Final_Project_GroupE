Here's a recommendation:\n\n### Bet Recommendation: Moneyline Bet on Boston Celtics\n- **Bet Type**: Moneyline\n- **Team**: Boston Celtics\n- **Odds**: 1.21 (DraftKings)\n- **Reasoning**: The Celtics are strong favorites to win against the Knicks. This is a safer bet given the odds and their performance.\n- **Win Probability**: High, given the odds and team strength.\n\nWith your $5 bankroll, betting on the Celtics to win would return approximately $6.05 if they win.\n\nThis is a \"lock\" bet, meaning it's a safer option for beginners. Always remember to bet responsibly and only wager what you can afford to lose. Enjoy the game! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.",
